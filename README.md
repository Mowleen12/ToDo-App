# ToDo-App

This To-Do app was created using Flutter by learning through YouTube tutorials. The app allows users to add, view, and delete tasks in a simple, user-friendly interface. The project helped me gain hands-on experience with Flutterâ€™s widgets, state management, and UI design while enhancing my mobile development skills. It is a great starting point for anyone looking to understand Flutter and how to build functional apps.
